# CMPG-323-Project-4---33757550
Project 4 - Testing and PRA

## Project 4 Description

This project is used for the testing and use of PRA's. The stakeholders will be able to test the project. This project automatically fills in the login details, then the project will create, view, edit and delete the Zones, Categories and the Devices.

This project might struggle to run the first time it is run but the second time it works perfectly.

The user would use the report to test the functionality of the Web Application.

##### Diagram
The diagram explaining project and repository context and how they are integrated. The blocks in blue are the feutures or main aspects within the projects and everything underneath a blue block is extra information about what needs to happen in the projects. At the top of the diagram is the Portfolio of Evidence(POE) as it is what I plan on completing with all off these projects that are integrated into one big Portfolio of Evidence.



###### Branching Strategy
For all projects I have decided to use Git flow branching strategy as I will be able to isolate my work into different types of branches. Each project will automatically have a main branch. There are many of the projects that will also contain a develop branch and maybe even a feature branch.

.gitignore file
The .gitignore file is a plain text file that will contain patterns of files/directories to ignore within each project. Only files that are put into the .gitignore file will be ignored. Within each project there will be certain files that need to be ignored and that is why the .gitignore file will be used.

###### Storage of credentials and sensitive information
It is important to ensure that credentials and sensitive information be stored properly so as to ensure that no one that is not authorized can access this information. To protect this information we can implement a safety precaution such as a username and password that needs to be put in correctly in order for credentials and sensitive information to become available. 

##### Project 2 - API Development

In this project we have created an API to execute certain functions. GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE methods are created. The stakeholdes will only get use of the data as it is an API. The stakeholders can use this data to help them with decision making.

##### Project 3 - Standards and Patters

This project will initialise the API into a reade and the working state. The coding is done with certain standars and I refrain from repeating code.
